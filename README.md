# Load-Oanda-Price-Data-Into-Numpy-Arrays-Pandas-Data-Frames
A short python "recipe" used to load Oanda Forex price data into Numpy Arrays and Pandas Data Frames for Analyzing. 

This recipe sends a request to Oanda's server to get the price data requested in the form of candles and then converts the data from a list to a Numpy Array and Pandas Dataframe. I created this ready to use script to help me bootstrap some Forex Machine learning algorithms I was working on.
